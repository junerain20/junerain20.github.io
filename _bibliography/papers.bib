abstract="First proposed in CryptoNote, a collection of popular privacy-centric cryptocurrencies have employed Linkable Ring Signature and a corresponding Key Derivation Mechanism (KeyDerM) for keeping the payer and payee of a transaction anonymous and unlinkable. The KeyDerM is used for generating a fresh signing key and the corresponding public key, referred to as a stealth address, for the transaction payee. The stealth address will then be used in the linkable ring signature next time when the payee spends the coin. However, in all existing works, including Monero, the privacy model only considers the two cryptographic primitives separately. In addition, to be applied to cryptocurrencies, the security and privacy models for Linkable Ring Signature should capture the situation that the public key ring of a signature may contain keys created by an adversary (referred to as adversarially-chosen-key attack), since in cryptocurrencies, it is normal for a user (adversary) to create self-paying transactions so that some maliciously created public keys can get into the system without being detected .",

abstract = {Smart devices without an interactive UI (e.g., a smart bulb) typically rely on specific provisioning schemes to connect to wireless networks. Among all the provisioning schemes, SmartCfg is a popular technology to configure the connection between smart devices and wireless routers. Although the SmartCfg technology facilitates the Wi-Fi configuration, existing solutions seldom take into serious consideration the protection of credentials and therefore introduce security threats against Wi-Fi credentials.This paper conducts a security analysis against eight SmartCfg based Wi-Fi provisioning solutions designed by different wireless module manufacturers. Our analysis demonstrates that six manufacturers provide flawed SmartCfg implementations that directly lead to the exposure of Wi-Fi credentials: attackers could exploit these flaws to obtain important credentials without any substantial efforts on brute-force password cracking. Furthermore, we keep track of the smart devices that adopt such Wi-Fi provisioning solutions to investigate the influence of the security flaws on real world products. Through reversely analyzing the corresponding apps of those smart devices we conclude that the flawed SmartCfg implementations constitute a wide potential impact on the security of smart home ecosystems.},

abstract = {Code-based masking schemes have been shown to provide higher theoretical security guarantees than Boolean masking. In particular, one interesting feature put forward at CARDIS 2016 and then analyzed at CARDIS 2017 was the so-called security order amplification: under the assumption that the leakage function is linear, it guarantees that an implementation performing only linear operations will have a security order in the bounded moment leakage model larger than  $d-1$ , where  $d$  is the number of shares. The main question regarding this feature is its practical relevance. First of all, concrete block ciphers do not only perform linear operations. Second, it may be that actual leakage functions are not perfectly linear (raising questions regarding what happens when one deviates from such assumptions). In this paper, we show that the issue of only linear operations can be provably avoided and that it is possible to obtain security order amplification for any functionality to implement. We then show that (not so) slightly non-linear leakage functions do not annihilate the nice properties (i.e., that the code-based schemes we consider remain interesting compared to the Boolean masking). We conclude with a performance evaluation of the proposals, showing that the performance overheads are moderate for a reasonable number of shares (we studied when the number of the shares  $d=2,3,4$ ). In additiona, our results could be specified to the case of provable security for low entropy masking, which can be considered as a side bonus of our contributions. We give some preliminary results on how to construct the low entropy masking schemes with provable high security order against linear leakage.},
