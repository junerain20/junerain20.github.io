abstract = {The overhead of non-linear functions dominates the performance of the secure multiparty computation (MPC) based privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). This work introduces a family of novel secure three-party computation (3PC) protocols, Bicoptor, which improve the efficiency of evaluating non-linear functions. The basis of Bicoptor is a new sign determination protocol, which relies on a clever use of the truncation protocol proposed in SecureML (S&amp;P 2017). Our 3PC sign determination protocol only requires two communication rounds, and does not involve any preprocessing. Such sign determination protocol is well-suited for computing non-linear functions in PPML, e.g. the activation function ReLU, Maxpool, and their variants. We develop suitable protocols for these non-linear functions, which form a family of GPU-friendly protocols, Bicoptor. All Bicoptor protocols only require two communication rounds without preprocessing. We evaluate Bicoptor under a 3-party LAN network over a public cloud, and achieve more than 370,000 DReLU/ReLU or 41,000 Maxpool (find the maximum value of nine inputs) operations per second. Under the same settings and environment, our ReLU protocol has a one or even two orders of magnitude improvement to the state-of-the-art works, Falcon (PETS 2021) or Edabits (CRYPTO 2020), respectively without batch processing.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of distributed computing, the traditional zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are becoming less adequate for privacy-preserving applications in the distributed setting. Take “double financing” as an example: multiple financial providers jointly prove that the sum of their committed values is no more than a given threshold, which generalizes the “range proof” to the multiple-prover setting. Therefore, traditional zero-knowledge proof does not seemingly lend itself to this problem on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We identify and fill this gap by formalizing the ZKP system in the multi-prover setting (MPZK) that proves arbitrary NP statements with distributed witnesses. Our MPZK system offers zero-knowledge as long as one prover is honest (while others can collude arbitrarily), and thus is applicable to “double financing”, “credit checking”, and various other multi-prover applications. We then propose a generic black-box construction from multiparty computation, referred to as “MPC-in-Multi-Heads”, and prove its security under the simulation-based paradigm. We also offer a proof-of-concept implementation and present its experimental results.},

abstract="First proposed in CryptoNote, a collection of popular privacy-centric cryptocurrencies have employed Linkable Ring Signature and a corresponding Key Derivation Mechanism (KeyDerM) for keeping the payer and payee of a transaction anonymous and unlinkable. The KeyDerM is used for generating a fresh signing key and the corresponding public key, referred to as a stealth address, for the transaction payee. The stealth address will then be used in the linkable ring signature next time when the payee spends the coin. However, in all existing works, including Monero, the privacy model only considers the two cryptographic primitives separately. In addition, to be applied to cryptocurrencies, the security and privacy models for Linkable Ring Signature should capture the situation that the public key ring of a signature may contain keys created by an adversary (referred to as adversarially-chosen-key attack), since in cryptocurrencies, it is normal for a user (adversary) to create self-paying transactions so that some maliciously created public keys can get into the system without being detected .",

abstract = {Pseudorandom functions PRFs play a central role in symmetric cryptography. While in principle they can be built from any one-way functions by going through the generic HILL SICOMP 1999 and GGM JACM 1986 transforms, some of these steps are inherently sequential and far from practical. Naor, Reingold FOCS 1997 and Rosen SICOMP 2002 gave parallelizable constructions of PRFs in NC$$^2$$2 and TC$$^0$$0 based on concrete number-theoretic assumptions such as DDH, RSA, and factoring. Banerjee, Peikert, and Rosen Eurocrypt 2012 constructed relatively more efficient PRFs in NC$$^1$$1 and TC$$^0$$0 based on "learning with errors" LWE for certain range of parameters. It remains an open problem whether parallelizable PRFs can be based on the "learning parity with noise" LPN problem for both theoretical interests and efficiency reasons as the many modular multiplications and additions in LWE would then be simplified to AND and XOR operations under LPN.In this paper, we give more efficient and parallelizable constructions of randomized PRFs from LPN under noise rate $$n^{-c}$$n-c for any constant $$0 Furthermore, our constructions are security-lifting by exploiting the redundancy of low-noise LPN. We show that in addition to parallelizability in almost constant depth the PRF enjoys either of or any tradeoff between the following:A PRF on a weak key of sublinear entropy or equivalently, a uniform key that leaks any $$1 - o1$$1-o1-fraction has comparable security to the underlying LPN on a linear size secret.A PRF with key length $$lambda $$λ can have security up\"{\i} \'{z}to $$2^{Olambda /log lambda }$$2Oλ/logλ, which goes much beyond the security level of the underlying low-noise LPN. where adversary makes up\"{\i} \'{z}to certain super-polynomial amount of queries.},

For any 1-to-1 one-way function, we give an optimal construction of UOWHFs with key and output length $$varTheta (n)$$ by making a single call to the underlying OWF. This improves the constructions of Naor and Yung (STOC 1989) and De Santis and Yung (Eurocrypt 1990) that need key length $$O(ncdot omega ({log {n})})$$.

For any known-(almost-)regular one-way function with known hardness, we give an optimal construction of UOWHFs with key and output length $$varTheta (n)$$ and a single call to the one-way function.

For any known-(almost-)regular one-way function, we give a construction of UOWHFs with key and output length $$O(n{cdot }omega (1))$$ and by making $$omega (1)$$ non-adaptive calls to the one-way function. This improves the construction of Barhum and Maurer (Latincrypt 2012) that requires key and output length $$O(n{cdot }omega (log {n}))$$ and $$omega (log {n})$$ calls.

For any weakly-regular one-way function introduced by Yu et al. at TCC 2015 (i.e., the set of inputs with maximal number of siblings is of an $$n^{-c}$$-fraction for some constant c), we give a construction of UOWHFs with key length $$O(n{cdot }{log }n)$$ and output length $$varTheta (n)$$. This generalizes the construction of Ames et al. (Asiacrypt 2012) which requires an unknown-regular one-way function (i.e., $$c=0$$).

Along the way, we use several techniques that might be of independent interest. We show that almost 1-to-1 (except for a negligible fraction) one-way functions and known (almost-)regular one-way functions are equivalent in the known-hardness (or non-uniform) setting, by giving an optimal construction of the former from the latter. In addition, we show how to transform any one-way function that is far from regular (but only weakly regular on a noticeable fraction of domain) into an almost-regular one-way function.},

abstract="Leakage-resilient cryptography aims at formally proving the security of cryptographic implementations against large classes of side-channel adversaries. One important challenge for such an approach to be relevant is to adequately connect the formal models used in the proofs with the practice of side-channel attacks. It raises the fundamental problem of finding reasonable restrictions of the leakage functions that can be empirically verified by evaluation laboratories. In this paper, we first argue that the previous ``bounded leakage'' requirements used in leakage-resilient cryptography are hard to fulfill by hardware engineers. We then introduce a new, more realistic and empirically verifiable assumption of simulatable leakage, under which security proofs in the standard model can be obtained. We finally illustrate our claims by analyzing the physical security of an efficient pseudorandom generator (for which security could only be proven under a random oracle based assumption so far). These positive results come at the cost of (algorithm-level) specialization, as our new assumption is specifically defined for block ciphers. Nevertheless, since block ciphers are the main building block of many leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives, our results also open the way towards more realistic constructions and proofs for other pseudorandom objects.",

abstract="Recently, there has been renewed interest in basing cryptographic primitives on weak secrets, where the only information about the secret is some non-trivial amount of (min-) entropy. From a formal point of view, such results require to upper bound the expectation of some function f(X), where X is a weak source in question. We show an elementary inequality which essentially upper bounds such `weak expectation' by two terms, the first of which is independent of f, while the second only depends on the `variance' of f under uniform distribution. Quite remarkably, as relatively simple corollaries of this elementary inequality, we obtain some `unexpected' results, in several cases noticeably simplifying/improving prior techniques for the same problem.",

abstract="One of the main challenges in leakage-resilient cryptography is to obtain proofs of security against side-channel attacks, under realistic assumptions and for efficient constructions. In a recent work from CHES 2012, Faust et al. proposed new designs of stream ciphers and pseudorandom functions for this purpose. Yet, a remaining limitation of these constructions is that they require large amounts of public randomness to be proven leakage-resilient. In this paper, we show that tweaked designs with minimum randomness requirements can be proven leakage-resilient in minicrypt. That is, either these constructions are secure, or we are able to construct public-key cryptographic primitives from symmetric-key building blocks and their leakage functions (which is very unlikely). Hence, our results improve the practical relevance of two important leakage-resilient pseudorandom objects.",

abstract = {Smart devices without an interactive UI (e.g., a smart bulb) typically rely on specific provisioning schemes to connect to wireless networks. Among all the provisioning schemes, SmartCfg is a popular technology to configure the connection between smart devices and wireless routers. Although the SmartCfg technology facilitates the Wi-Fi configuration, existing solutions seldom take into serious consideration the protection of credentials and therefore introduce security threats against Wi-Fi credentials.This paper conducts a security analysis against eight SmartCfg based Wi-Fi provisioning solutions designed by different wireless module manufacturers. Our analysis demonstrates that six manufacturers provide flawed SmartCfg implementations that directly lead to the exposure of Wi-Fi credentials: attackers could exploit these flaws to obtain important credentials without any substantial efforts on brute-force password cracking. Furthermore, we keep track of the smart devices that adopt such Wi-Fi provisioning solutions to investigate the influence of the security flaws on real world products. Through reversely analyzing the corresponding apps of those smart devices we conclude that the flawed SmartCfg implementations constitute a wide potential impact on the security of smart home ecosystems.},

abstract = {Code-based masking schemes have been shown to provide higher theoretical security guarantees than Boolean masking. In particular, one interesting feature put forward at CARDIS 2016 and then analyzed at CARDIS 2017 was the so-called security order amplification: under the assumption that the leakage function is linear, it guarantees that an implementation performing only linear operations will have a security order in the bounded moment leakage model larger than  $d-1$ , where  $d$  is the number of shares. The main question regarding this feature is its practical relevance. First of all, concrete block ciphers do not only perform linear operations. Second, it may be that actual leakage functions are not perfectly linear (raising questions regarding what happens when one deviates from such assumptions). In this paper, we show that the issue of only linear operations can be provably avoided and that it is possible to obtain security order amplification for any functionality to implement. We then show that (not so) slightly non-linear leakage functions do not annihilate the nice properties (i.e., that the code-based schemes we consider remain interesting compared to the Boolean masking). We conclude with a performance evaluation of the proposals, showing that the performance overheads are moderate for a reasonable number of shares (we studied when the number of the shares  $d=2,3,4$ ). In additiona, our results could be specified to the case of provable security for low entropy masking, which can be considered as a side bonus of our contributions. We give some preliminary results on how to construct the low entropy masking schemes with provable high security order against linear leakage.},
